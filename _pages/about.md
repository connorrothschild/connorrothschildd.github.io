title: "Hi, I'm Connor Rothschild"
---

I'm a junior at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) studying Social Policy Analysis and Political Science, and pursuing a minor in data science.

I'm currently working as an intern for the [Texas Policy Lab](https://www.texaspolicylab.org/profile/connor-rothschild/), a research fellow for the [Religion and Public Life Program at Rice University](https://rplp.rice.edu/staff-and-fellows), and a data science fellow with [Bluebonnet Data](https://www.bluebonnetdata.com).

This website serves to host all of my technical writings. You'll find (almost exclusively) R scripts and data visualizations, but I'm also actively learning other tools like [D3.js](https://github.com/connorrothschild/D3.js) and [Python](https://github.com/connorrothschild/Python).

If you'd like a more holistic view of my portfolio (not just code stuff!), you can find my other website [here](https://www.connorrothschild.com). I encourage you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-rothschild/), follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CL_Rothschild), or check out my [CV](https://connorrothschild.github.io/markdown-cv/).

Thanks for visiting!
